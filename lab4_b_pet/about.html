            <h4> 
               Born on June 7th, 2005, in Skopje, I am Agnesa.<br>
Zodiac sign: Gemini.<br>
Ethnicity: Albanian. <br>
Based in: Skopje, North Macedonia.<br>
Languages: Albanian (native), Macedonian, and English. <br> </h4><br>
<p> 
My name is Agnesa Suli, and just a few days ago, I turned 20.
I am currently a student at the Faculty of Computer Engineering and Computer Science, at the University of "Ss. Cyril and Methodius" in Skopje, majoring in Computer Science.
<br>
I consider myself a colorful personality — I don’t know if it’s because I’m a Gemini or simply because I still haven’t found my full self among all the possibilities life offers us today.
I enjoy challenges (evident by the fact that I study at FINKI), I love adventures, photography, and literature — but I’ll talk more about that in the
 <a href="#hobis"> Hobbies</a>
  section.
<br>
When it comes to computer science, I’ve always been curious about how things work — how to build them, how to improve them, and how to make them serve a purpose.
<br>
And finally, to answer the frequently asked question:
"Will AI replace humans?"
Personally, I believe that AI will actually give us — programmers and professionals of all kinds — more time. Time to think, to analyze, and to solve the core problems of our fields, while AI takes care of the writing, scripting, and unnecessary micro-details.
<br>
I don’t believe in competition — and I don’t think humans should either — because as long as we were capable of creating AI, we are capable of growing beyond it.

            <h3>My random Beliefs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Everything, in its own way, is tied to art.</li>
                <li>Tiny details can reshape the entire meaning.</li>
                <li>We all end up being the black sheep in someone’s story.</li>
                <li> Life is a stage, and each day, we improvise the script we live by.</li>
